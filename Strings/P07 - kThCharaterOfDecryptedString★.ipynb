    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given an Encrypted String where repetitions of substrings are represented as substring followed by the count of substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** String \"aabbbcdcdcd\" will be encrypted as \"a2b3cd3\".\\\n",
    "You need to find the 'K'th character of Decrypted String. Decrypted String would have 1-based indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note :**\\\n",
    "Input string will always be lowercase characters without any spaces.\n",
    "If the count of a substring is 1 then also it will be followed by Integer '1'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"aabcdee\" will be Encrypted as \"a2bcd1e2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This means it's guaranteed that each substring is followed by some Integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the frequency of encrypted substring can be of more than one digit. For example, in \"ab12c3\", ab is repeated 12 times. No leading 0 is present in the frequency of substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of a repeated substring can also be in parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"aaaabbbb\" can also have \"a2a2b3b1\" as Encrypted String.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input 1 :**\\\n",
    "a2b3cd3\\\n",
    "8\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output 1 :**\\\n",
    "c\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation to Sample Input 1 :**\\\n",
    "S = \"a2b3cd3\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrypted String of S** = \"aabbbcdcdcd\"\n",
    "\n",
    "According to 1-based indexing for S, the 8th character is 'c'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input 2 :**\\\n",
    "ab12c3\\\n",
    "20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output 2 :**\\\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation to Sample Input 2 :**\\\n",
    "S = \"ab12c3\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrypted String of S** = \"ababababababababababababccc\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So 20th character is 'b'."

    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem efficiently, we don't need to actually decrypt the entire string, which could be very inefficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially if the counts of substrings are large. Instead, we can simulate the decryption process by keeping track of the length of the decrypted string as we parse the encrypted string, and identify the 'K'th character without full decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is a step-by-step algorithm to achieve the optimal solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize variables:\n",
    "    - index to keep track of the current index in the encrypted string.\n",
    "    - decryptedLength to keep track of the length of the decrypted string so far.\n",
    "    - currentSubstring to temporarily hold the substring that is currently being processed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Iterate through each character of the encrypted string.\n",
    "    - If the character is a letter, append it to currentSubstring.\n",
    "    - If the character is a digit, it might be part of a multi-digit number. Accumulate the digits to form the complete number (the count of repetitions of currentSubstring).\n",
    "        - To handle multi-digit numbers, continue reading the next characters until you encounter a non-digit character.\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Once you have the complete count of the current substring, multiply the length of currentSubstring by this count and add it to decryptedLength.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If decryptedLength becomes greater than or equal to 'K' during this process, you know that the 'K'th character is within the current substring.\n",
    "    - Calculate the exact position of the 'K'th character within currentSubstring and return that character.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you reach the end of the encrypted string and decryptedLength is still less than 'K', it means 'K' is out of bounds for the decrypted string, so you should return an error or an indication that 'K' is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is a pseudo-code representation of the algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "function findKthCharacter(encryptedString, K):\n",
    "    index = 0\n",
    "    decryptedLength = 0\n",
    "    currentSubstring = \"\"\n",
    "    while index < length(encryptedString):\n",
    "        if isLetter(encryptedString[index]):\n",
    "            currentSubstring += encryptedString[index]\n",
    "            index += 1\n",
    "        elif isDigit(encryptedString[index]):\n",
    "            count = 0\n",
    "            while index < length(encryptedString) and isDigit(encryptedString[index]):\n",
    "                count = count * 10 + (int(encryptedString[index]) - '0')\n",
    "                index += 1\n",
    "            decryptedLength += length(currentSubstring) * count\n",
    "            if decryptedLength >= K:\n",
    "                repeatIndex = (K - (decryptedLength - length(currentSubstring) * count)) - 1\n",
    "                return currentSubstring[repeatIndex % length(currentSubstring)]\n",
    "            currentSubstring = \"\"\n",
    "    return \"Invalid K\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Helper functions to determine if a character is a letter or a digit\n",
    "function isLetter(char):\n",
    "    return 'a' <= char <= 'z'\n",
    "function isDigit(char):\n",
    "    return '0' <= char <= '9'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, the time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the encrypted string, as we're only looping through it once. The space complexity is O(m) where m is the maximum length of the repeated substring, which is used to store currentSubstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can implement this algorithm in your preferred programming language, following the logic described above."
