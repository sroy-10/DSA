    "## Counting Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting sort is an integer sorting algorithm, a method of sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Counting sort works best when the range of potential items (the key space of the items) is not significantly greater than the number of items to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a high-level description of how counting sort works:\n",
    "1. Find the range of input values (maximum and minimum).\n",
    "1. Initialize an array of counters (often called a \"count array\") with a length equal to the range of input values. Each position in the count array corresponds to a value in the input range.\n",
    "1. Count the number of occurrences of each value in the input array and place that count in the corresponding position of the count array.\n",
    "1. Modify the count array by adding the count of the previous index to each position, except for the first. This step accumulates the counts, which gives the positions of each key in the sorted array.\n",
    "1. Iterate through the input array in reverse order (to maintain stability) and place the items into a new array (the sorted array) according to the positions calculated in the count array. Decrease the count in the count array each time an item is placed.\n",
    "1. Copy the sorted array back into the original input array if in-place sorting is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If the array is traversed from back, then the count needs to be decrease. If the array is traversed from front, then the count needs to be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm has a time complexity of **O(n + k)**, where n is the number of elements to sort and k is the range of input. Counting sort is efficient if the range of input data **(k)** is not significantly larger than the number of objects to sort because the space complexity is also **O(n + k)**, which can become impractical if k is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of counting sort is that it is a stable sort; that is, if two items have the same key, their relative order will be the same in the sorted output as it was in the input. This is an important property when sorting data by multiple keys (as in radix sort).\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting sort is often used as a subroutine in more complex sorting algorithms like radix sort, which can handle larger keys more efficiently by breaking them into smaller digits and sorting each digit using counting sort or another stable sort.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Coding Ninja Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ninja is studying sorting algorithms. He has studied all comparison-based sorting algorithms and now decided to learn sorting algorithms that do not require comparisons.\n",
    "He was learning counting sort, but he is facing some problems. Can you help Ninja implement the counting sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:**\\\n",
    "You are given ‘ARR’ = {-2, 1, 2, -1, 0}. The sorted array will be {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\\\n",
    "1 <= T <= 10 \\\n",
    "1 <= N <= 5000\\\n",
    "-10^4 <= ARR[i] <= 10^4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time limit:** 1 sec\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\\\n",
    "You do not need to input or print anything, as it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input 1:**\\\n",
    "2\\\n",
    "5\\\n",
    "-2 1 2 -1 0\\\n",
    "5\\\n",
    "1 2 3 -4 -5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output 1:**\\\n",
    "-2 -1 0 1 2\\\n",
    "-5 -4 1 2 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\\\n",
    "For the first test case, the sorted array will be {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}.\\\n",
    "For the second test case, the sorted array will be {-5, -4, 1, 2, 3}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input 2:**\\\n",
    "2\\\n",
    "4\\\n",
    "1 3 4 2\\\n",
    "4\\\n",
    "1 1 -1 -1\n",

    "**Sample Output 2:**\\\n",
    "1 2 3 4\\\n",
    "-1 -1 1 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement indicates that you must implement a Counting Sort algorithm that can handle negative numbers. Traditional Counting Sort assumes that the numbers are non-negative. However, with the presence of negative numbers in the input, we need to adjust the algorithm accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a **step-by-step** guide on how to implement the Counting Sort to handle negative numbers:\n",
    "1. Find the minimum and maximum value in the input array to determine the range.\n",
    "1. Create a count array with a size equal to the range of the input values plus one, to account for zero.\n",
    "1. Initialize the count array with zeros.\n",
    "1. Offset the input values by subtracting the minimum value from each element, to convert all numbers to non-negative.\n",
    "1. Count the occurrences of each number in the input array and increment the corresponding index in the count array.\n",
    "1. Modify the count array to make it a cumulative count, which will determine the positions of the elements in the sorted array.\n",
    "1. Iterate over the input array in reverse (to maintain stability) and construct the sorted array based on the cumulative counts, decrementing the count for each number as it is placed.\n",
    "1. Adjust the sorted array by adding the minimum value back to each element to restore the original values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's the implementation in pseudocode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "function countingSort(ARR, N):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Find the range of the input values\n",
    "    minVal = min(ARR)\n",
    "    maxVal = max(ARR)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 2: Create and initialize the count array\n",
    "    range = maxVal - minVal + 1\n",
    "    countArray = [0] * range\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 3: Offset and count the occurrences\n",
    "    for num in ARR:\n",
    "        countArray[num - minVal] += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 4: Modify the count array to be cumulative\n",
    "    for i from 1 to range - 1:\n",
    "        countArray[i] += countArray[i - 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 5: Construct the sorted array\n",
    "    sortedArray = [0] * N\n",
    "    for i from N - 1 to 0 by -1:\n",
    "        num = ARR[i]\n",
    "        countArray[num - minVal] -= 1\n",
