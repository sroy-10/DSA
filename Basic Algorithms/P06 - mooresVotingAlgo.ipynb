    "# Moore's Voting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moore's Voting Algorithm**, also known as the \"Majority Vote Algorithm\", is an efficient algorithm designed to find the majority element in a sequence of elements, if one exists. The majority element is defined as an element that appears more than half the time in the sequence. This algorithm was developed by Robert Moore in 1981.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty slate, considering no candidate for the majority element. Set two variables: one for the candidate element (candidate) and another for counting (count), initialized to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Pass (Candidate Selection)**: Iterate through the elements of the array.\n",
    "    - For each element, if the current count is 0, set the candidate to the current element and set count to 1.\n",
    "    - If the count is not 0, increment the count if the current element is the same as the candidate, or decrement the count if it's different.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Second Pass (Validation)**: After the first pass, the candidate will be the element that might be the majority element. However, this needs to be confirmed because if there's no majority element, the algorithm could still return a candidate.\n",
    "    - Reset the count to 0 and iterate through the array again, counting the number of times the candidate appears.\n",
    "    -If the candidate appears more than half the time (i.e., count > size/2, where size is the number of elements in the array), then the candidate is the majority element. Otherwise, there is no majority element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of Moore's Voting Algorithm is that it requires **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space, making it very efficient for this specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "function findMajorityElement(arr):\n",
    "    candidate = null\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    // First Pass\n",
    "    for element in arr:\n",
    "        if count == 0:\n",
    "            candidate = element\n",
    "        if element == candidate:\n",
    "            count += 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            count -= 1\n",
    "    // Second Pass (Optional: Only if you need to verify the candidate is indeed the majority)\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    for element in arr:\n",
    "        if element == candidate:\n",
    "            count += 1\n",
    "    if count > length(arr) / 2:\n",
    "        return candidate\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"No Majority Element\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second pass is necessary only if you need to confirm that the candidate is actually the majority element, as the first pass will always produce a candidate regardless of whether or not there is a majority element in the sequence."
