    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem in-place without using any extra space, you can follow a two-step process: first transpose the matrix and then reverse each row. The transposition of the matrix will exchange rows with columns, and the reversal of each row will give the effect of rotating the matrix by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction.\n",

    "\t\n",
    "2. Reverse each row. After the transposition, the elements will be in the correct columns, but in reverse order. By reversing each row, you'll get the matrix rotated by 90 degrees in the anti-clockwise direction."
