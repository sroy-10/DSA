    "**Output:** 2\\\n",
    "**Explanation:**\\\n",
    "The square root of the number 7 lies between 2 and 3, so the floor value is 2.\n",

    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem with an optimal time complexity of **O(log(n))**, we can use a binary search algorithm. The space complexity of this approach will be **O(1)** since we are not using any additional space that grows with the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's the step-by-step algorithm:**\n",
    "1. If n is 0 or 1, return n directly since the square root of 0 is 0, and the square root of 1 is 1.\n",
    "2. Initialize two variables, start and end. Let start be 1 and end be n.\n",
    "3. While start is less than or equal to end, do the following:\n",
    "\t- Compute mid as the midpoint of start and end (use start + (end - start) / 2 to avoid integer overflow).\n",
    "\t- Calculate mid squared and compare it with n.\n",
    "\t- If mid squared is less than or equal to n, it could be the potential answer, so store it. Then, to find if there's a higher value whose square is still less than or equal to n, set start to mid + 1.\n",
    "\t- If mid squared is greater than n, we have gone too far, so set end to mid - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop ends, return the stored potential answer."
