    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array 'ARR' and an integer 'K', your task is to find all the count of all sub-arrays whose sum is divisible by the given integer 'K.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "If there exists no subarray in the given sequence whose sum is divisible by 'K' then simply return \"O'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Suppose the given array is 'ARR' = {5, 0, 2, 3, 1} and 'K = 5'. \\\n",
    "As we can see in below image, there are a total of 6 subarrays that have the total sum divisible by 'K'. So we return the integer 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input 1:**\\\n",
    "2  \n",
    "3 2  \n",
    "2 3 1  \n",
    "4 1  \n",
    "1 2 3 4  \n",

    "**Explanation of sample input 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Case 1:**\\\n",
    "Given ‘ARR’ is { 2, 3,1 } and ‘K’ is ‘2’. \\  \n",
    "All the sub-array with sum is divided by ‘K’ are -  \\\n",
    "{ 2 }  because the sum is 2 and sum 2 is divisible by 2  \\\n",
    "{ 3, 1 } because the sum is 3 + 1 = 4 and sum 4 is divisible by 2.  \\\n",
    "{ 2, 3, 1 } because the sum is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 and sum 6 is divisible by 2.  \\\n",
    "Hence there is a total of three subarrays that has sum divisible by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Case 2:**\\\n",
    "Given ‘ARR’ is { 1, 2, 3, 4 } and ‘K’ is ‘1’.  \\\n",
    "Given ‘K’ is 1 that’s why each and every sub-arrays sum will be divisible by ‘1’ and with the size of ‘4’ array total number of subarray possible is ‘( 4*5 /2 ) = 20/2 = 10’.  \\\n",
    "All possible subarray -  \\\n",
    "{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4 }, { 1, 2 }, { 2, 3 }, { 3, 4 }, { 1, 2, 3 }, { 2, 3, 4 }, { 1, 2, 3, 4 } and all subarray sum is divisible by ‘1’.  \\\n",
    "Hence there are overall 10 subarrays that has sum divisible by ‘1’.  \n",

    "1. If currentSum is 0, then the subarray from the start to the current index has a sum of 0. Update maxLength if this subarray is longer than the current maxLength.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If currentSum is already present in the hash map, it means there is a subarray with sum 0 between the first occurrence of currentSum and the current index. \n",
