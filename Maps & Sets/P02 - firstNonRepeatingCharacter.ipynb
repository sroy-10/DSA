    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Ninja is now bored with numbers and is now playing with characters but hates when he gets repeated characters. Ninja is provided a string, and he wants to return the first unique character in the string. The string will contain characters only from the English alphabet set, i.e., ('A' - 'Z') and ('a' - 'z'). If there is no non-repeating character, print the first character of the string. If there is no non-repeating character, return the first character of the string.\n",

    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use a hash map (or a dictionary in Python) to keep track of the count of each character in the string. We then iterate over the string a second time to find the first character with a count of 1 in the hash map. This approach ensures we have an optimal time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the string since we are only iterating over the string twice. The space complexity is O(1) because the size of the hash map is bounded by the size of the English alphabet, which is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's the step-by-step algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Initialize a hash map to store the count of each character in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Traverse the entire string:\n",
    "    - For each character, increment its count in the hash map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Traverse the string a second time:\n",
    "    - For each character, check its count in the hash map.\n",
    "    - If the count is 1, this is the first non-repeating character, return it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If no non-repeating character is found, return the first character of the string."
